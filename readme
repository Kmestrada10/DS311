If you go to this link you could create a account and add locations to it then go to the crime tab and see crime happening nearby.
However, currently this only has Chicago data, so only Chicago data is displayed other locations can be added but no data will be displayed of crime. 
I would recomend using an account I made that already has locations: 

Email: user@gmail.com
Passowrd: password 

Another note, I did not give all the files since it would be alot of html and css. So I gave the part that displays the crime data, retrives data from "https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/6zsd-86xi.json", and also what cleans up data.
